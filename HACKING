# This file contains guidelines on ebuild masking and Ubuntu releases #

* Current Ubuntu release versions of ebuilds are always masked by ~arch package.keywords
* Development Ubuntu release versions of ebuilds are always masked by missing keywords
* Development Ubuntu release packages list is maintained in unity-gentoo_<dev_release>.pkeywords,
	this way the packages may be tracked and easily tested by symlinking into /etc/portage/package.keywords/
