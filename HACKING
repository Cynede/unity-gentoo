# This file contains guidelines on ebuild masking and Ubuntu releases #

* Current Ubuntu release versions of ebuilds are always masked by ~arch package.keywords
* Development Ubuntu release versions of ebuilds are always masked by missing keywords
* Development Ubuntu release packages list is maintained in unity-gentoo_<dev_release>.pkeywords,
	this way the packages may be tracked and easily tested by symlinking into /etc/portage/package.keywords/
* Any ebuild that installs *.desktop file(s) AND specifies pkg_postinst(), must specify ubuntu-versionator_pkg_postinst
	within pkg_postinst() {...} so that /usr/share/applications/bamf-2.index remains up-to-date
