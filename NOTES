* To rebuild all packages against new GTK libs using qdepends (part of app-portage/portage-utils):
emerge -1 `qdepends -CNQ x11-libs/gtk+ 2> /dev/null`

* Ubuntu uses the compiz gconf plugin (unity-base/compizconfig-backend-gconf) to read the list of default compiz plugins for using Unity
	The overlay however achieves this by passing the same list of plugins to compiz using the cmake -DCOMPIZ_DEFAULT_PLUGINS=... switch at build time
	If you're interested in getting the gconf way working, look at 'unity-base/compiz/files/gconf-defaults/compiz-gnome.gconf-defaults'
		and the 'unity-base/compiz/files/gconf-defaults/update-gconf-defaults' application
	EDIT: Ubuntu have indicated they will be porting compiz to use dconf instead of gconf for Quantal, so wait until they do before attempting this
		One side effect of the port is that unity-2d will be dropped in favour of using llvmpipe/gallium software rendering for unity-3d,
		which could mean that we can drop patching QT as we only really do this currently for unity-2d to function

* Using portage tree libindicate packages
	- unity-base/indicator-appmenu requires
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu, dev-libs/libindicator and dev-libs/libappindicator all be built with x11-libs/gtk:2 support
	- Many indicators (bluetooth, weather, etc.) require dev-libs/libappindicator be built with Python GTK+-2.x bindings to function
	- Gentoo is in the position of dropping GTK+-2.x Ubuntu Ayatana libraries from tree so we must maintain our own versions of
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu
		dev-libs/libindicator
		dev-libs/libappindicator

* Some artifact glitches may sometimes show on 'Dash Home' HUD on intial use. Alt+Tab'bing to 'Show Desktop' cleans this up.

* Quantal Upgrade
	- Packages require >=dev-libs/glib-2.33.10 which breaks nautilus thumbnail previews
		>=unity-base/indicator-session-12.10
	- Packages require gtk+-3.5 which needs testing against main tree GTK applications
		>=unity-base/indicator-appmenu-12.10
		>=unity-base/indicator-datetime-12.10
	# BUGS #
	Nautilus consumes 95% CPU when idle
	gtk+-3.5 breaks gtk-engines-unico GTK themes including Quantal's Ambiance theme as it uses unico, and so causes Unity to fail at runtime

* Core python deps. for Unity and it's Dash lens to work
