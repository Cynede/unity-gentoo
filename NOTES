* To rebuild all packages against new GTK and QT libs using qdepends (part of app-portage/portage-utils):
emerge -1 `qdepends -CNQ x11-libs/gtk+ 2> /dev/null`
emerge -1 `qdepends -CNQ x11-libs/qt 2> /dev/null`

* Ubuntu QT patchset and Gentoo's QT split ebuilds
 - Ubuntu's QT patchset is downloaded and applied in qt4-build.eclass and is mostly needed for unity2d to function with some QT5 accessibility backports
 - With the exception of x11-libs/qt-gui, all QT ebuilds in the overlay are direct copies of those in the main portage tree and serve as placeholders for the 99. version prefix
 - x11-libs/qt-gui has the following changes:
	src/qtdeclarative added to QT4_TARGET_DIRECTORIES after src/qtgui to enable qt-gui to build
	x11-libs/qt-sql and x11-libs/qt-xmlpatterns added to DEPEND

* Until Ubuntu start using sys-apps/dbus-1.6, Unity needs <sys-apps/dbus-1.6 for the indicator panel to refresh itself
	This has the effect of also needing <dev-libs/dbus-glib-0.100 and <dev-python/dbus-python-1.1.1

* Ubuntu uses the compiz gconf plugin (unity-base/compizconfig-backend-gconf) to read the list of default compiz plugins for using Unity
	The overlay however achieves this by passing the same list of plugins to compiz using the cmake -DCOMPIZ_DEFAULT_PLUGINS=... switch at build time
	If you're interested in getting the gconf way working, look at 'unity-base/compiz/files/gconf-defaults/compiz-gnome.gconf-defaults'
		and the 'unity-base/compiz/files/gconf-defaults/update-gconf-defaults' application
