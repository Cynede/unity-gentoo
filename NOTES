* To rebuild all packages against new GTK and QT libs using qdepends (part of app-portage/portage-utils):
emerge -1 `qdepends -CNQ x11-libs/gtk+ 2> /dev/null`
emerge -1 `qdepends -CNQ x11-libs/qt 2> /dev/null`

* Ubuntu QT patchset and Gentoo's QT split ebuilds
 - Ubuntu's QT patchset is downloaded and applied in qt4-build.eclass and is mostly needed for unity2d to function with some QT5 accessibility backports
 - With the exception of x11-libs/qt-gui, all QT ebuilds in the overlay are direct copies of those in the main portage tree and serve as placeholders for the 99. version prefix
 - x11-libs/qt-gui has the following changes:
	src/qtdeclarative added to QT4_TARGET_DIRECTORIES after src/qtgui to enable qt-gui to build
	x11-libs/qt-sql and x11-libs/qt-xmlpatterns added to DEPEND

* Ubuntu uses the compiz gconf plugin (unity-base/compizconfig-backend-gconf) to read the list of default compiz plugins for using Unity
	The overlay however achieves this by passing the same list of plugins to compiz using the cmake -DCOMPIZ_DEFAULT_PLUGINS=... switch at build time
	If you're interested in getting the gconf way working, look at 'unity-base/compiz/files/gconf-defaults/compiz-gnome.gconf-defaults'
		and the 'unity-base/compiz/files/gconf-defaults/update-gconf-defaults' application
	EDIT: Ubuntu have indicated they will be porting compiz to use dconf instead of gconf for Quantal, so wait until they do before attempting this
		One side effect of the port is that unity-2d will be dropped in favour of using llvmpipe/gallium software rendering for unity-3d,
		which could mean that we can drop patching QT as we only really do this currently for unity-2d to function

* Using portage tree libindicate packages
	- unity-base/indicator-appmenu requires
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu, dev-libs/libindicator and dev-libs/libappindicator all be built with x11-libs/gtk:2 support
	- Many indicators (bluetooth, weather, etc.) require dev-libs/libappindicator be built with Python GTK+-2.x bindings to function
	- Gentoo is in the position of dropping GTK+-2.x Ubuntu Ayatana libraries from tree so we must maintain our own versions of
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu
		dev-libs/libindicator
		dev-libs/libappindicator

* Some artifact glitches may sometimes show on 'Dash Home' HUD on intial use. Alt+Tab'bing to 'Show Desktop' cleans this up.

* Quantal Upgrade
	unity-base/indicator-session-12.10*
		requires >=dev-libs/glib-2.33.10 and dev-libs/glib-2.33.10 breaks nautilus thumbnail previews
	unity-base/indicator-appmenu-12.10*
		requires >=x11-libs/gtk+-3.5 and gtk+-3.5 needs testing against main tree GTK applications

* Core python deps. for Unity and it's Dash lens to work
	dev-libs/dee
	dev-libs/libappindicator
	dev-libs/libunity
	unity-base/launchpad-integration	# Not python-3 compatible
	unity-base/unity-lens-video
	unity-base/unity-scope-video-remote
	x11-proto/xcb-proto
