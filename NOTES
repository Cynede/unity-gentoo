* To rebuild all packages against new GTK and QT libs using qdepends (part of app-portage/portage-utils):
emerge -1 `qdepends -CNQ x11-libs/gtk+ 2> /dev/null`
emerge -1 `qdepends -CNQ x11-libs/qt 2> /dev/null`

* Ubuntu QT patchset and Gentoo's QT split ebuilds
 - Ubuntu's QT patchset is downloaded and applied in qt4-build.eclass and is mostly needed for unity2d to function with some QT5 accessibility backports
 - With the exception of x11-libs/qt-gui, all QT ebuilds in the overlay are direct copies of those in the main portage tree and serve as placeholders for the 99. version prefix
 - x11-libs/qt-gui has the following changes:
	src/qtdeclarative added to QT4_TARGET_DIRECTORIES after src/qtgui to enable qt-gui to build
	x11-libs/qt-sql and x11-libs/qt-xmlpatterns added to DEPEND

* Ubuntu uses the compiz gconf plugin (unity-base/compizconfig-backend-gconf) to read the list of default compiz plugins for using Unity
	The overlay however achieves this by passing the same list of plugins to compiz using the cmake -DCOMPIZ_DEFAULT_PLUGINS=... switch at build time
	If you're interested in getting the gconf way working, look at 'unity-base/compiz/files/gconf-defaults/compiz-gnome.gconf-defaults'
		and the 'unity-base/compiz/files/gconf-defaults/update-gconf-defaults' application

* Using portage tree libindicate packages
	- unity-base/indicator-appmenu requires
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu, dev-libs/libindicator and dev-libs/libappindicator all be built with x11-libs/gtk:2 support
	- Many indicators (bluetooth, weather, etc.) require dev-libs/libappindicator be built with Python GTK+-2.x bindings to function
	- Gentoo is in the position of dropping GTK+-2.x Ubuntu Ayatana libraries from tree so we must maintain our own versions of
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu
		dev-libs/libindicator
		dev-libs/libappindicator

* Some artifact glitches may sometimes show on 'Dash Home' HUD on intial use. Alt+Tab'bing to 'Show Desktop' cleans this up.
