* To rebuild all packages against new GTK and QT libs using qdepends (part of app-portage/portage-utils):
emerge -1 `qdepends -CNQ x11-libs/gtk+ 2> /dev/null`
emerge -1 `qdepends -CNQ x11-libs/qt 2> /dev/null`

* Ubuntu QT patchset and Gentoo's QT split ebuilds
 - Ubuntu's QT patchset is downloaded and applied in qt4-build.eclass and is mostly needed for unity2d to function with some QT5 accessibility backports
 - With the exception of x11-libs/qt-gui, all QT ebuilds in the overlay are direct copies of those in the main portage tree and mostly serve as placeholders for the 99. version prefix
 - x11-libs/qt-gui has some extra qtdeclarative targets added to enable qt-gui to build
