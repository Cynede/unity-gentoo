* To rebuild all packages against new GTK libs using qdepends (part of app-portage/portage-utils):
emerge -1 `qdepends -CNQ x11-libs/gtk+ 2> /dev/null`

* Using portage tree libindicate packages
	- unity-base/indicator-appmenu requires
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu, dev-libs/libindicator and dev-libs/libappindicator all be built with x11-libs/gtk:2 support
	- Many indicators (bluetooth, weather, etc.) require dev-libs/libappindicator be built with Python GTK+-2.x bindings to function
	- Gentoo is in the position of dropping GTK+-2.x Ubuntu Ayatana libraries from tree so we must maintain our own versions of
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu
		dev-libs/libindicator
		dev-libs/libappindicator

* Core python deps. for the Dash lens to work
	dev-libs/dee
	dev-libs/libappindicator
	dev-libs/libunity
	unity-base/launchpad-integration	# Not python-3 compatible
	unity-base/unity-lens-video
	unity-base/unity-scope-video-remote

* Reasons for patching packages:
dev-libs/dee				# Mainline portage tree ebuild lacks support for multi-python ABI installation needed by Dash lenses
dev-libs/libappindicator		# See above
dev-libs/libdbusmenu			# See above
dev-libs/libindicator			# See above
gnome-base/gconf			# Installs 'update-gconf-defaults' script used by compiz to install compizconfig default settings into gconf registry
gnome-base/gnome-control-center		# Include Dash Launcher Appearance and UbuntuOne settings
gnome-base/gnome-menus			# Needed for some menu patches but mostly to set XDG_MENU_PREFIX when running in gnome fallback mode
gnome-base/gnome-session		# Installs session files for launching Unity desktop
gnome-base/gnome-settings-daemon	# Patched to have gnome-settings-daemon xdg-autostart on Unity login
gnome-base/gsettings-desktop-schemas	# Includes Unity desktop settings patches
gnome-base/nautilus			# Give progressbar on Dash launcher nautilus icon
gnome-extra/gnome-screensaver		# Patched to have gnome-screensaver xdg-autostart on Unity login
gnome-extra/nm-applet			# Shows nm-applet in indicator panel
gnome-extra/polkit-gnome		# Patched to have polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1 xdg-autostart on Unity login
net-im/empathy				# Integrates with Unity online accounts and it's associated plugins
net-wireless/gnome-bluetooth		# Shows bluetooth in indicator-panel
x11-base/xorg-server			# Needed for revealing side Dash launcher panel when it's set to autohide
x11-libs/gtk+				# Needed for global appmenu
x11-themes/gtk-engines-unico		# Patched to work with Unity's default theme for gtk+-3.6 (Unity fails to start otherwise)
x11-wm/metacity				# Patched to support compiz window decoration
