* To rebuild all packages against new GTK libs using qdepends (part of app-portage/portage-utils):
emerge -1 `qdepends -CNQ x11-libs/gtk+ 2> /dev/null`

* Using portage tree libindicate packages
	- unity-indicators/indicator-appmenu requires
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu, dev-libs/libindicator and dev-libs/libappindicator all be built with x11-libs/gtk:2 support
	- Many indicators (bluetooth, weather, etc.) require dev-libs/libappindicator be built with Python GTK+-2.x bindings to function
	- Gentoo is in the position of dropping GTK+-2.x Ubuntu Ayatana libraries from tree so we must maintain our own versions of
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu
		dev-libs/libindicator
		dev-libs/libappindicator

* Core python deps. for the Dash lens to work
	dev-libs/dee
	dev-libs/libappindicator
	dev-libs/libunity
	unity-base/launchpad-integration	# Not python-3 compatible
	unity-lenses/unity-lens-video

* Reasons for patching/maintaining packages:
dev-cpp/gtest				# Customised ebuild to install /usr/src/gtest/* files lacking from main tree ebuild
dev-cpp/gmock				# Customised ebuild to install /usr/src/gmock/* files lacking from main tree ebuild

* Empathy and message indicator integration
	- To reset all empathy accounts and configurations:
		rm -rfv ~/.cache/telepathy
		rm -rfv ~/.local/share/telepathy
		rm -rfv ~/.config/libaccounts-glib
		rm -rfv ~/.config/Empathy
	- To debug signond, edit /etc/signond.conf and change 'LoggingLevel=...'
	- To debug signon-ui:
		killall signon-ui
		export SSOUI_LOGGING_LEVEL=2
		signon-ui
	- To debug telepathy packages:
		G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all FOO_PERSIST=1 FOO_DEBUG=all /path/to/telepathy-foo 2>&1 | tee foo.log

* Webapps integration
	- Requires the following packages:
		- dev-libs/libunity-webapps
		- unity-base/webapps
		- x11-misc/webapps-greasemonkey			(Unity Websites Integration browser plugin)
		- x11-misc/webaccounts-browser-extension	(Ubuntu Online Accounts browser plugin)
		- x11-misc/unity-firefox-extension		(Unity Desktop Integration browser plugin)
		- x11-misc/unity-chromium-extension		(Unity Desktop Integration browser plugin)

	- Problems:
		- 'unity-webapps-runner' (unity-base/unity-webapps) is used by the *.desktop files installed by
			Ubuntu packages but will only work if either chromium or firefox are set as the default browser
			Default browser setting is read from desktop user's ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list
	- Other stuff:
		- Webapps shown in the messages indicator are provided by the desktop user's ~/.local/share/applications/<provider>.desktop
		- Available webapps are stored in the desktop user's ~/.local/share/unity-webapps/availableapps-v2.db
		- Installed webapps are stored in the desktop user's ~/.local/share/unity-webapps/apps2.db
	- To reset all installed webapps back to zero (and so get re-prompted to integrate each site), and remove indicator integration:
		rm -rfv ~/.local/share/applications/<webapp_provider>.desktop
		gsettings set com.canonical.unity.webapps allowed-domains ['']
	- Possible TODO:
		- Package Ubuntu's version of app-misc/geoclue so that the Amazon webapp regional settings work when running 'unity-webapps-runner -a'

* Debugging Unity
	- Emerge unity-base/nux with the 'debug' USE flag enabled, then:
		echo 'export UNITY_LOG_SEVERITY="unity=DEBUG"' > /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/99-unity-debug
		echo 'export UNITY_LOG_SEVERITY="nux=DEBUG"' >> /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/99-unity-debug
		chmod +x /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/99-unity-debug
		Restart xsession
	- Check ~/.xsession-errors
	- gsettings get org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ active-plugins

* Customising gnome-control-center entries comes by way of Ubuntu's 'ubuntu_external_panels.patch' for gnome-control-center
	- With this patch launchers are supposed to be added to gnome-control-center when their .desktop file is named in the following format
		gnome-'panelname'-panel.desktop or 'panelname'-ccpanel.desktop

	- There are also a list of launchers hardcoded into the patch that gnome-control-center needs to know about at compile time
		in shell/cc-panel-loader.c as seen below:

		/* This is a list of desktop file launchers that should be loaded
			where they are available */
		static struct {
		  const char *name;
		} all_launchers[] = {
		  {"gufw"},
		  {"landscape-client-settings"},
		  {"language-selector"},
		  {"software-properties-gtk"},
		  {"system-config-printer"},
		  {"ubuntuone-installer"},
		};

* Mir EGL Display Server
	- Circular dependencies between mir-base/mir and media-libs/mesa
		- Mesa requires mir support patch
		- mir-base/mir requires libGL from media-libs/mesa to build
		- media-libs/mesa with mir enabled requires mirclient from mir-base/mir
			- SOLUTION:
				- Introduce media-libs/mesa-mir ebuild that installs only the mesa EGL related files and DEPENDS on mir-base/mir
				- Introduce 'mir' useflag to media-libs/mesa which when enabled removes all EGL related files and PDEPENDS on media-libs/mesa-mir
