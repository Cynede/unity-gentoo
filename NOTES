* To rebuild all packages against new GTK libs using qdepends (part of app-portage/portage-utils):
emerge -1 `qdepends -CNQ x11-libs/gtk+ 2> /dev/null`

* Using portage tree libindicate packages
	- unity-base/indicator-appmenu requires
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu, dev-libs/libindicator and dev-libs/libappindicator all be built with x11-libs/gtk:2 support
	- Many indicators (bluetooth, weather, etc.) require dev-libs/libappindicator be built with Python GTK+-2.x bindings to function
	- Gentoo is in the position of dropping GTK+-2.x Ubuntu Ayatana libraries from tree so we must maintain our own versions of
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu
		dev-libs/libindicator
		dev-libs/libappindicator

* Some artifact glitches may sometimes show on 'Dash Home' HUD on intial use. Opening any application then Alt+Tab'bing to 'Show Desktop' cleans this up.

* Quantal Upgrade
	- Packages require >=dev-libs/glib-2.33.10 which breaks nautilus thumbnail previews
		>=unity-base/indicator-session-12.10	# Currently we patch out the new glib requirement
		>=unity-base/indicator-power-12.10.0	# Stick with unity-base/indicator-power-2.0 for now
	- Packages require gtk+-3.5 which needs testing against main tree GTK applications
		>unity-base/indicator-appmenu-12.10.0	# Stick with unity-base/indicator-appmenu-0.3.97 for now
		>unity-base/indicator-datetime-12.10.0	# Currently we patch out the dependance on EDS-3.5 and so gtk+-3.5
	# BUGS #
	Nautilus consumes 95% CPU when idle
	gtk+-3.5 breaks gtk-engines-unico GTK themes including Quantal's Ambiance theme as it uses unico, and so causes Unity to fail at runtime

* Core python deps. for Unity and it's Dash lens to work
	dev-libs/dee
	dev-libs/libappindicator
	dev-libs/libunity
	unity-base/launchpad-integration	# Not python-3 compatible
	unity-base/unity-lens-video
	unity-base/unity-scope-video-remote
