unity-gentoo
============

A Gentoo overlay to install the Unity desktop

~ # emerge -at unity-meta

* If you experience blocks with regard to x11-libs/qt packages, then do:
  ~ # emerge -1a $(qlist -IC x11-libs/qt)

This will upgrade all at once your already installed QT packages to the new overlay version.
If you're missing the 'qlist' command then 'emerge portage-utils'.
