Be aware!!
The unity-gentoo overlay includes package versions that are heavily patched by Ubuntu.
To preserve the function of the overlay packages from being broken by main tree upgrades,
some package versions in the overlay are prefixed with '99.' so that they become the preferred
choice.
Packages effected are:
gnome-base/gnome-settings-daemon
gnome-extra/nm-applet
net-wireless/gnome-bluetooth
x11-libs/gtk+
