Be aware!!
The unity-gentoo overlay includes package versions that are heavily patched by Ubuntu.
To preserve the function of the overlay packages from being broken by main tree upgrades,
some package versions in the overlay are prefixed with '99.' so that they become the preferred
choice.
Packages effected are:
dev-libs/dee
dev-libs/libappindicator
dev-libs/libdbusmenu
dev-libs/libindicator
dev-libs/libzeitgeist
gnome-base/gconf
gnome-base/gnome-control-center
gnome-base/gnome-menus
gnome-base/gnome-session
gnome-base/gnome-settings-daemon
gnome-base/gsettings-desktop-schemas
gnome-base/nautilus
gnome-extra/gnome-screensaver
gnome-extra/nm-applet
gnome-extra/polkit-gnome
gnome-extra/zeitgeist-datahub
net-wireless/gnome-bluetooth
x11-libs/gtk+
