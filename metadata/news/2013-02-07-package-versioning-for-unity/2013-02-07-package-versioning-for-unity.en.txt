Be aware!!
The unity-gentoo overlay includes package versions that are heavily patched by Ubuntu.
To preserve the function of these integrated packages from being broken by main portage tree upgrades,
the affected packages need to be masked from being emerged from the main portage tree

Packages affected are:
dev-libs/dee
dev-libs/libappindicator
dev-libs/libdbusmenu
dev-libs/libindicator
gnome-base/gconf
gnome-base/gnome-control-center
gnome-base/gnome-menus
gnome-base/gnome-session
gnome-base/gnome-settings-daemon
gnome-base/gsettings-desktop-schemas
gnome-base/nautilus
gnome-extra/gnome-screensaver
gnome-extra/nm-applet
gnome-extra/polkit-gnome
net-im/empathy
net-wireless/gnome-bluetooth
www-client/chromium
x11-libs/gtk+
x11-themes/gtk-engines-unico
x11-wm/metacity

The overlay requires symlinking the file 'unity-portage.pmask' to '/etc/portage/package.mask/unity-portage.pmask'
	'ln -s /var/lib/layman/unity-gentoo/unity-portage.pmask /etc/portage/package.mask/unity-portage.pmask'

package.unmask files override package.mask files, so be sure that none of the packages listed above already lie in your
	/etc/portage/package.unmask file, or if they do that they unmask in a repo specific way
		eg. www-client/chromium::unity-gentoo

All packages are keyword masked and require keyword unmasking by adding '*/*::unity-gentoo' to your package.keywords file
